It is an unfortunate reality that client-side code is often not given the same level of care and attention that is given to server-side code. Many times this "client-side inferiority complex" is aggravated as web developers move between server-side frameworks and have to re-learn how to manage client-side code within the opinions of that server-side framework.

A lack of consistency in the way client-side code is managed across server-side frameworks has left many web developers frustrated, disillusioned, or apathetic when it comes to caring about the quality of the client-side code that they write.

We built Lineman to craft a developer experience that would liberate our client-side assets from the opinions of each server-side framework and allow them to stand on their own as first-class citizens. At its core, Lineman is a fully realized client-side workflow based on sensible task defaults and a simple transparent proxy that allows web developers to completely decouple their client-side from the server-side. In addition, it produces happiness by building assets, mocking servers, and running specs on every file change.

This separation allows rich-client web applications to stand on their own as first-class citizens and grants significant flexibility to decouple client and server.
