Lineman is a command-line utility that is hyper-focused on helping web developers build fat-client JavaScript web applications. Lineman provides a thin wrapper around a number of client-side productivity tools (primarily Express, Grunt, and Testem), with the goal of helping developers focus on writing awesome webapps instead of worrying about workflow configuration.

It is powered by Node.JS, and works on Windows, Mac and Linux.
